# Who am I?

I'm a product designer and Python developer who creates digital products with a focus on harmony between aesthetics and functionality. My dual specialization allows me not only to design interfaces but also to bring them to life.

Currently, I'm traveling around Asia, based in Bali, and working with clients from all over the world via Upwork.

## What do I do?

### In design:
I create user experiences that turn complex processes into intuitive interfaces. I work with wireframes, prototypes, design systems, and prepare specifications for developers.

### In development: 
I build automated solutions that save time and resources — Telegram bots with AI integration, data parsers, and workflow automation systems.

## What will this blog be about?

Here I'll share:

- Case studies of my projects with process and solution details
- Tutorials on product design and Python development
- Insights from travels and remote work from different parts of the world
- The development process of my pet project TalentX

> "I strive to create products that not only look great but also solve real user problems."

## My goal

I believe the best solutions emerge at the intersection of design, technology, and understanding human needs.
