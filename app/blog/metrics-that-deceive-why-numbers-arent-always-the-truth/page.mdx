# Metrics That Deceive: Why Numbers Aren't Always the Truth

Metrics aren't everything. But they sure look pretty, right? ðŸ™‚

---

## Why Metrics Can Be Misleading

Rising numbers on a dashboard don't guarantee a better product or user experience. It's important not just to count, but to understand the reasons behind the changes.

---

## Retention

**Bad scenario:** Retention grows because users can't delete their account or find the right feature.

**Good scenario:** Retention grows because users return for new features or content.

### What to check:
- Is it easy to delete an account?
- Is it clear how to cancel a subscription?
- Do you have a survey: "Why did you return?"

**Practical solution:** Add a "Delete account" button, a short survey after return, and analyze not just returns but also complaints.

## Conversion Rate

**Bad scenario:** CR grows because users don't understand what they're buying or miss important details.

**Good scenario:** CR grows because the purchase process is clearer.

### What to check:
- Are there hints at every step?
- Is there a comment/question field?
- Do you analyze reasons for returns?

**Practical solution:** Add hints, a short survey after purchase, and analyze not just CR but also returns.

---

## Time on Screen

**Bad scenario:** Time increases because users are lost.

**Good scenario:** Time increases because users are exploring valuable new features.

### What to check:
- Is it easy to find what you need?
- Are there search and hints?
- Do you analyze completed target actions?

**Practical solution:** Add search, hints, and analyze completed actions.

---

## CTR, Likes, Clicks

**Bad scenario:** CTR grows, but nothing happens after the click.

**Good scenario:** CTR grows, and users perform target actions.

### What to check:
- Do you track actions after the click?
- Do you ask: "What made you click?"

**Practical solution:** Track not just clicks but real actions, and add a question after the click.

## Metrics Workflow Algorithm

1. Define your goal (what exactly do you want to improve)
2. Choose several metrics, not just one
3. Add qualitative questions for users
4. Analyze not just numbers, but the reasons for changes
5. Regularly review your approach and metrics

> "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted." â€” William Bruce Cameron

## Conclusion

Metrics are a tool, not a goal. Control not just the numbers, but the real reasons behind user actions.

Remember that behind every number is a real user with real needs and experiences. Sometimes the most valuable insights come not from what you can measure, but from what you can observe and understand through qualitative research.

As you build and refine your products, challenge yourself to look beyond the dashboard and ask: "Are we measuring what truly matters to our users?"
