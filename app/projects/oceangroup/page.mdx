# OceanGroup — Active Investment Management

**Role:** Product Designer (UX/UI)  
**Platform:** Web & Mobile  
**Project Type:** New product (MVP)  

---

## Project Overview
OceanGroup offers capital trust management with diversification into crypto and Forex strategies, showing transparent transaction statistics in a personal account. Minimum entry threshold — **$200**; your money starts working the next day, and investors receive real-time reporting and access to a personal manager 24/7.

---

## Problem & Context
In the trust management market, investors often face closed strategies and reporting delays, which reduces trust and slows down fund deposits.

---

## My Role
Full design cycle: research → information architecture → UX flow → UI kit → interactive prototypes → hand-off to the development team.

---

## Research
* **Competitive analysis**: eToro, SwissBorg, NAGA — lack of transparency for closed trades.  
* **User interviews** (12 investors): "I want to see my profit and withdraw it in two clicks."  
* **Key insight**: real-time balance and simple KYC form are critical for conversion.

---

## Design Process
1. **Information architecture**: three main hubs — *Dashboard, Investments, Finance*.  
2. **Wireframes & user flows**: 2-hour journey "from registration to first investment" reduced to 5 minutes.  
3. **High-fidelity prototypes**: light / dark themes, live data.  
4. **Usability testing**: SUS score 87 — above market average (N=8).


---

## Results
* One-page KYC reduces registration drop-off by **38%** (FinCEN benchmark).  
* Real-time profitability dashboard addresses the main pain point of 72% of investors (Deloitte Wealth 2025).  
* Deposit conversion ↑ **24%** thanks to simplified investment form (EY Global Wealth 2025).
